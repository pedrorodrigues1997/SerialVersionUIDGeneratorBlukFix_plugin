How to Use the SerialVersionUID Generator Plugin
1. Install the Plugin
From JetBrains Marketplace:

    Open IntelliJ IDEA.
    Go to File > Settings > Plugins.
    Click Browse Repositories and search for SerialVersionUID Generator.
    Click Install and restart IntelliJ IDEA.

From a .zip File:

    Download the plugin .zip file.
    Go to File > Settings > Plugins.
    Click Install plugin from disk and select the downloaded .zip file.

2. Automatic Detection of Missing serialVersionUID

The plugin automatically detects classes that implement or inherit from Serializable but lack a serialVersionUID. These classes will be highlighted in the editor.

    Open any Java file in your project that implements Serializable.
    The plugin will highlight classes missing a serialVersionUID.

3. Generate serialVersionUID Using Quick Fix

To add a serialVersionUID to a class, use the plugin's Quick Fix:

    Place your cursor on the class that is missing serialVersionUID.
    Press Alt + Enter (or right-click and select Show Context Menu).
    Select Generate serialVersionUID from the available actions.
    The plugin will generate a unique serialVersionUID and add it to your class.

4. Handle Complex Inheritance Scenarios

The plugin also ensures that classes with complex inheritance chains (e.g., classes implementing multiple interfaces or extending other Serializable classes) are properly handled.
5. Configuration (Optional)

You can configure the pluginâ€™s behavior through File > Settings > Inspections. This allows you to enable or disable the inspections and quick fixes based on your preferences.
Conclusion

With the SerialVersionUID Generator plugin, you can ensure that your Java classes implementing Serializable are always correctly declared with a serialVersionUID. This not only saves time but also prevents potential serialization issues and runtime errors. Whether you're working on a small project or a large codebase, this plugin makes it easier to maintain Java's serialization standards automatically.
